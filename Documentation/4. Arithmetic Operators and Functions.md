# Arithmetic Operators and Functions
This file contains details about all the Arithmetic operators and functions. All of them affect the **binaryContents** member as it holds the actual value.
All these operators and functions are public, and they are divide as follows:

- ## Binary Operators:
  This means that the operator takes two inputs (including [*this]).
  All these operators have two overloads, the first one with the input is another **unsignedBigInteger** called by reference,
  while the second with the input as unsigned 64-bit integer. There are in total 10 operators, 5 with and 5 without the assignment.
  The functions with assignment return **unsignedBigInteger** by reference, while the others without referncing.

  - ### Addition (operator+):
    The first overload will add two **unsignedBigInteger** variables and store the result in a third one which will be returned.
    It starts adding the elements of [binaryContents](/Documentation/1.%20Members.md#binarycontents) from both of them, while checking for carry in each step.
    A carry is added to the next element, and an element of value 1 is added at the end if the last adding operation resulted in a carry.
    
    Carry detection can be done by comparing in each step.
    
  - ### Subtraction (operator-):
    
  - ### Muliplying (operator*):
    
  - ### Integer Division (operator/) and Modulus (operator%):
    
  - ### Addition Assignment (operator+=):
    
  - ### Subtraction Assignment (operator-=):
    
  - ### Muliplying Assignment (operator*=):
    
  - ### Integer Division Assignment (operator/=) and Modulus Assignment (operator%=):
    

- ## Unary Operators:
  This means that the operator takes only one input [*this].
  There are only 2 unary operators which are:
  - ### operator++:
    Which increment the value by 1.
  - ### operator--:
    Which decrement the value by 1.

- ## Arithmetic Functions:
  Some of these functions are necessary to the operators above, and some are extra. These functions are as follows:
  - ### Divide by unsignedBigInteger Function:
    Which is defined as `friend bool Divide(unsignedBigInteger& dividend, unsignedBigInteger& divisor, unsignedBigInteger& quotient, unsignedBigInteger& remainder)`.
    It returns *(the returned bool value)* whether the division operation was successful.
    It will calculate both the integer division result (**quotient**) and the residual/modulus (**remainder**), so logically, these will be the outputs of the function,
    while the inputs will be the **dividend** (numerator) and **divisor** (denominator). Notice that all of these "inputs" are called **by reference**.
    However, only the last two variables will be updated in the function.
    
  - ### Divide by 32-bit unsigned integer Function:
    Which is defined as `friend bool Divide(unsignedBigInteger& dividend, unsigned int& divisor, unsignedBigInteger& quotient, unsigned int& remainder)`.
    It returns *(the returned bool value)* whether the division operation was successful.
