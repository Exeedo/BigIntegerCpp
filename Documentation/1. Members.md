# Members of unsignedBigInteger class:
- ## binaryContents
  This is the main and most important member in the class. It is a vector of 64-bit unsigned integer (*unsigned long long* in C++),
  which is used to store the big integer in its binary form. Each element contains a 64-bit part of the number represented by this
  class, starting from 0 at the least significant part. All arithmetic, comparison, bitwise and shifting functions affect the
  contents of this vector.

- ## decimalContents
  This member is only used when converting the actual number stored in binary to decimal format (to be printed for example).
  It is a vector of unsigned integer where each element contains a 9-digit part of the number starting from 0 at the least
  significant part.

- ## MAX_SIZE
  This member is an unsigned integer to limit the size of **binaryContents**. It is initialized to 32768 such that the size of
  binaryContents to be around 256 KB. *Currently, there is no operation or function to increase this element.*

- ## Reserved Members:
  These members are reserved for future purposes:
    - ### isConvertedToDecimal: 
      which is a boolean variable to check whether the number is converted to decimal and stored in **decimalContents** in its last updated value.
    - ### alwaysConvertToDecimal:
      which is a boolean variable to keep the values of **decimalContents** updated in decimal as last updated value of **binaryContents**.
