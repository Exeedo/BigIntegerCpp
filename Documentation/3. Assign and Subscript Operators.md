# Assign Operators
All these operators are *public*.
- ## unsignedBigInteger& operator=(const unsignedBigInteger& other)
  This operator copies the contents of **other** to the variable.
  Similar to the constructor, this will be done in **O(N)**, where **N** is the length of the **binaryContents** of **other**. (complexity of copying a vector)

- ## unsignedBigInteger& operator=(unsigned long long other)
  This operator assigns the value of **other** to the variable. This will be done in **O(1)**.

# Subscript Operator
This operator is *private* since version 1.1. It accesses the **binaryContents** by reference.
It is used a lot throughout the code, so this implementation makes it easier. This will be done in **O(1)**.
