# Assign Operators
- ## unsignedBigInteger& operator=(const unsignedBigInteger& other)
This operator copies the contents of **other** to the variable.

- ## unsignedBigInteger& operator=(unsigned long long other)
This operator assigns the value of **other** to the variable.

# Subscript Operator
This operator accesses the **binaryContents** by reference. It is used a lot throughout the code, so this implementation makes it easier.
