# Comparison Operators and Function
This file contains details about all Comparison operators and functions. 
All operators are *public* while the last function is *private*.

- ## Comparison Operators:
  All these operators internally call the comparison function from the below to do the actual comparison.
  Then each of them compares the value returned by the comparison function to zero using the respective operator (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=).
  Each operator has two overloads, the first one to compare [*this]
  with another **unsignedBigInteger** variable, while the other with an unsigned 64-bit variable.
  The first type of operators call the first overload of comparison function, while the second type call the second overload as well.
  
- ## Comparison Function:
  This function takes two values and return -1, 0, or 1 if the first [*this]
  was less than, equal to, or greatest than the second number **other**, respectively.
  This function has two overloads
